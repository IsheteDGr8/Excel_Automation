# Excel Automation Project
This is an automation project for handling Excel files, built using Python. The goal of this project is to provide an easy and efficient way to process, manipulate, and analyze Excel data.

## Features
- Read and write data to Excel files.
- Automate data processing tasks such as sorting, filtering, and calculations.
- Handle multiple Excel files in one go.
- Support for CSV files for data import/export.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (use `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsheteDGr8/Excel_Automation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Excel_Automation
3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Open the app.py file to see the automation script in action. The script can be run directly from the command line:
python app.py
2. Add your Excel files (e.g., transactions.xlsx, transactions2.xlsx) to the project folder, and the script will handle the automation.
3. You can modify the script to add more features, like new Excel processing tasks or automation workflows.
